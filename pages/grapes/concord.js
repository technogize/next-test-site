                <p>If you have ever had Welch’s classic grape juice, then you know exactly what the Concord tastes like. Bright, sweet and full of that signature dark grape flavor. In the early fall, you might see these perfect blue-purple orbs popping up in the farmers’ market. They have easy-to-peel skins and large seeds. As an added bonus, they smell fantastic!</p>
                <p>Where they grow: The Finger Lakes region in New York, Yakima Valley in Washington, Michigan and Lake Ontario</p>
