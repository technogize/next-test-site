            <p>Finger-like shape with dark purple, almost black skin. The flesh is firm and crunchy, giving this variety a nice snap that also helps it maintain in the refrigerator for days. Itâ€™s sweet, but not too sugary, and tastes a little like grape jelly.</p>
            <p>Where they grow: Central California</p>
